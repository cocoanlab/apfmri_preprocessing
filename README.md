# APFmri preprocessing pipeline

The fMRI data preprocessing pipeline for the Animal Pain fMRI project (APFmri). The codes here are currently used in an ongoing project, but I'm sharing them with a hope that these might be helpful to others (and also wanted to do version control and make the code-sharing and collaboration easier, of course). 

Some of the codes are still in progress. Thus, if you want to use the codes, please contact me first (choongwan.woo _at_ gmail _dot_ com).

Thanks!
