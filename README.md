# APFmri preprocessing pipeline

The fMRI data preprocessing pipeline for the Animal Pain fMRI project (APFmri). The codes here are currently used in an ongoing project, but I'm sharing them with a hope that these might be helpful to others (and also wanted to do version control and make the code-sharing and collaboration easier, of course). 

We're currently using these codes to process rhesus monkey's MRI/fMRI data, but the codes can be used for human and other animal brain with minimal changes. Currently, the main preprocessing tool is from spm8. 

Some of the codes are still in progress. Thus, if you want to use the codes, please contact me first (choongwan.woo _at_ gmail _dot_ com).

Thanks!
